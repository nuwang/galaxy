"""Serve a running job's inputs to a remote job runner from the object store.

Galaxy gives a remote runner (Pulsar) one signed URL per input (``input_url``,
kept beside the code that verifies it) instead of a path on its own disk. A request for such a URL is answered from the
object store by identity (``staged_input``): with a redirect to a presigned URL
when the URL asks for one and the store can issue it, else with a stream read
straight from the store, else from a local file (disk stores).
Nothing here needs a filesystem shared between Galaxy hosts.
